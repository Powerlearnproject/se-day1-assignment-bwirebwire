Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process of creating,designing and developing software for computer systems and electronic devices.
Software engineering provides the foundation for Industries by developing the software systems and infrastructure required for automation, connectivity, data analysis, and cybersecurity. It enables the digital transformation of industries, driving efficiency, innovation,enhancing healthcare services and new business models.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Birth of Software Engineering – The term was first used at the NATO Software Engineering Conference to address the "software crisis," where projects were failing due to poor planning and management.
2.Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming – The development of languages like Smalltalk and C++ led to the adoption of object-oriented programming (OOP), improving code reuse and maintainability.
3.Agile and DevOps Movements – The Agile Manifesto introduced iterative development, emphasizing flexibility and collaboration. DevOps later emerged to integrate development and operations for faster delivery

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Idea generation - define project goals
Requirement analysis -gather and document system requirements
Product design - Create software architecture and design specifications
Product development - write and develop actual software
Integration and testing - validate functionality and fix defects
Deployment - release software to users
Maintenance - updating and fixing bugs

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 waterfall is linear and sequential while agile is iterative and incremental
 waterfall is rigid while agile is highly flexible
 waterfall is done after development while agile is continuous throughout.
Examples:
Waterfall: Developing a flight control system where strict documentation and predictability are required.
Agile: Creating a mobile app that requires frequent updates based on user feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer – Writes and maintains code, follows coding standards, and implements features.
Quality Assurance Engineer – Designs and executes tests to identify software defects.
Project Manager – Oversees project timelines, manages resources, and ensures team coordination.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.	 
 Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) streamline coding by providing debugging, auto-completion, and compilation tools (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS) enable collaboration and track code changes (e.g., Git, Subversion (SVN)).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Collaboration Issues – Use project management tools like GitHub for transparency.
Tight Deadlines – Use Agile methodologies and efficient time management.
Technical Debt – Regular refactoring and code reviews help maintain quality.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
	Unit Testing – Tests individual components (e.g., a function in Python).
  Integration Testing – Verifies interactions between modules.
  System Testing – Tests the complete system to ensure it meets requirements.
  Acceptance Testing – Ensures the software meets user expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective prompts to get the best responses from AI models. It is crucial for improving AI-generated outputs in chatbots, search engines, and automation tools.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Prompt: "Tell me about Dogs."
Improved Prompt: "Explain the different breeds of dogs suitable for apartments."
It is specific, providing clear expectations and context for the AI to generate a more relevant and detailed response.
